PyJSA
=====
A python package for the simulation of the joint spectral amplitude of output photons from an SPDC source buit in a PPLN ridge waveguide.

Features
========
- Computation of the JSA, given signal and idler wavelengths and the poling structure of the waveguide
- Schmidt decomposition and purity
- Top-hat filters on both signal and idler channels and heralding efficiency computation

Installation
===========
You can install the package directly from pip:
::
  pip install pyjsa

Alternatively, you can manually install it from the repository. Clone the repository and run:
::
  python setup.py install
